Packages
========

You use Joomla Packages when you want to bundle together a number of Joomla extensions of different types.

The single operation of installing the package results in the installation of each of the constituent extensions.

To define a package you have

- a top level folder with the manifest file for the package

- subfolders for the package constituents, each extension with its own manifest file, etc.

See [Installating Extensions - Package](./install-update/installation/package.md) for details of 
the package manifest file and how to organise the constituents of the package.
